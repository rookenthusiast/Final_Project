Fantasy Strategy game

the premise for the fantasy game is to be able to manage resources in your city/domain and seige other players domains. 

resources will continually grow over real time mechanics. Players will be able to attack settlements to steal resources or take over them to then build upon. 

this will be a web based app that can later be ported over to mobile after testing on React and Ruby on Rails.
